# Bodyguard

A Parrot A.R. Drone 2.0 mod that transforms your quadrocopter into a personal security guard. It follows you around silently when you don't need it, and lets you take over via an intuitive Myo-based control scheme when you do-- giving you the power to shoot down your enemies with a mounted rubber band gun.

requires opencv, numpy, myo-python and python-ardrone
